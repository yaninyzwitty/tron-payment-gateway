what does this client require me to do, We need a modular USDT (TRC20) Payment Gateway built using Go and MySQL. The gateway should handle unique wallet address creation, real-time deposit monitoring, and transaction logging. Scope of work - Develop a secure USDT (TRC20) payment gateway in Go with MySQL. - Create API endpoint: POST /api/create-payment with client_id, account_id, amount. - Assign unique wallet address per payment with a 5-minute timer. - Implement auto-regeneration of address up to 3 times if payment is not received. - Use TronGrid or similar API for blockchain monitoring. - Confirm payments automatically and update their status in MySQL. - Include webhook support to notify frontend of payment updates. - Design MySQL database with tables for clients, accounts, payments, attempts, logs. - Ensure transaction logging, timer handling, and attempt tracking. - Provide complete Go backend code, MySQL database setup, migrations, Postman collection, and .env configuration.
